# ethereum-react-simple-tic-tac-toe-dapp
A Simple Distributed Tic Tac Toe Application using [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), a JavaScript library to make awesome UI by Facebook, [Ethereum Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), a framework for Ethereum blockchain development, and [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/), official language to write Smart Contracts in Ethereum.

This application uses [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) component oriented UI creation paradigm. All components are written in [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and ES6 style and are
combined to get a single build for production purpose using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). This application uses *Custom Hook* design feature introduced in [React JS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) v16.8. 

ES6 `module` creation along with `import /export`, `async/ await` is used. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) is used to *transpile* all [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) code to vanilla JavaScript code. To install all the dependecies `npm` is used.

Back end is implemented using [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/). Communication with the Smart Contracts is done using [Web3 JS](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/)


For UI creation [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) and [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) are used. [Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), the new feature of [CSS3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) is used for layout creation purpose.

This is a *responsive web application* for viewing in both Mobile and Desktop.

</ul>


<ul>
 <li>All the user moves, computer moes are stored in the <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.2/">Solidity</a> Smart Contract. As a result when you <i>refresh the page</i> you will get the current state of the game. </li>
 <li>No move is <b>lost</b>.</li>
</ul>

 
<ul>
 <li> Communication with the Smart Contracts is supported using <b>JSON RPC</b> by <a href="https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.6/">Web3 JS</a>  
</ul>  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/fanofsherlock/EthereumTicTacToe.git` from `Git Bash / Command Prompt`
2. Navigate inside the directory by `cd ethereum-react-simple-tic-tac-toe-dapp`
3. Install all the necessary dependecies by using `npm install`

5. Open another `Command Prompt` and Run it as Administrator (in Windows)  and navigate to the same directory `ethereum-react-simple-tic-tac-toe-dapp`
6. In the second Command prompt, run the *Truffle Development network* by `truffle develop`. Make sure you have installed <a href="https://www.trufflesuite.com/">Ethereum Truffle</a> in your macheine 
7. In the second Command prompt, deploy the blockchain by `truffle migrate`
8. Now in a Web browser navigate to `http://localhost:8081/Address` and enter your eth address and an automated computer's eth address
9. Click on "Go to Game" after entering the addresses in previous screen, it will navigate to `http://localhost:8081/Game` and it will deduct 10 ether from yours and computer's eth account
10. Once you are done playing the Tic tac toe game, the bounty of 20 eth is sent to the winner's address
